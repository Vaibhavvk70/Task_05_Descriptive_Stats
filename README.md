# Syracuse Women's Lacrosse Data Analysis

## 📘 Overview

This project involved analyzing the 2024 season statistics of the Syracuse University Women’s Lacrosse team. Using the official dataset provided [here](https://cuse.com/sports/womens-lacrosse/stats/2024-25) and a series of targeted natural language prompts, the objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of prompt engineering with a Large Language Model (LLM) like ChatGPT.

## 🎯 Objective

- Convert structured sports statistics into natural language prompts.
- Assess ChatGPT's ability to interpret and respond accurately.
- Extract strategic insights from data to simulate a coaching or analytics role.

## 📂 Files

- `Task 5 Data.pdf`: Source dataset for the SU Women's Lacrosse 2024 season.
- `Task 05_Prompts_Answers.docx`: List of prompts and corresponding LLM-generated answers.

## 🧠 Key Insights & Observations

- **Wins**: Syracuse won 16 out of 22 games (Home: 9–2, Away: 5–2, Neutral: 2–2).
- **Scoring Trends**: Most goals were scored in the 1st quarter (108), showing strong starts.
- **Shooting Accuracy**: Syracuse had a 72.91% shots-on-goal accuracy, outperforming opponents (66.49%).
- **Overtime Struggles**: Syracuse scored 0 OT goals vs 3 by opponents, losing all OT games.
- **Defense vs Offense**:
  - Offense was solid with +5.55 goals/game advantage.
  - Defensive vulnerabilities included ground ball losses (327 vs 352), fewer saves (154 vs 187), and weak overtime performance.
- **Free-Position Goals**: 19.4% of goals came from free-position shots.

## 🔍 Conclusion

- Syracuse’s strength lies in fast, aggressive starts and offensive execution.
- The team progressively lost edge as games continued, culminating in overtime losses.
- Key weaknesses include defensive depth, ground ball control, and goalie performance under pressure.

## 📌 Lessons Learned

- Prompt engineering is a powerful way to transform raw data into actionable insights using LLMs.
- Clarity and specificity in prompts directly impact the relevance and accuracy of LLM responses.
- Data-backed strategy formulation (e.g., emphasizing defense training) can emerge effectively from such analyses.
- LLMs can augment traditional sports analysis, especially when structured prompts are used systematically.

## 💡 Future Scope

- Include player-level stats to allow personalized coaching insights.
- Automate prompt generation from raw datasets.
- Expand to multi-season or multi-team comparisons.
